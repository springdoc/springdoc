= Contributing to springdoc-openapi

springdoc-openapi is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
If you would like to contribute something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.

== Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[code of
conduct].
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

== Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements.
If you have a general usage question please ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow].
The springdoc-openapi team and the broader community monitor the https://stackoverflow.com/tags/springdoc[`springdoc`]
tag.

These are some basic guidelines before opening an issue.
First of all you need to make sure, you don't create duplicate issues, and there no question already answered on https://stackoverflow.com/tags/springdoc.

If you are starting using springdoc-openapi, we advise you to use **the last available release**.

Then refer to the relevant documentation:

1. For OpenAPI specification 3:
- https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md
2. For swagger2-annotations:
- https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Annotations
3. For swagger-ui configuration:
- https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md
4. For springdoc-openapi:
- https://springdoc.org/
- https://springdoc.org/faq.html
- https://springdoc.org/migrating-from-springfox.html


If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible:

- You need to describe your context (the title of an issue is not enough)
- What version of spring-boot you are using?
- What modules and versions of springdoc-openapi are you using?
- What are the actual and the expected result using OpenAPI Description (yml or json)?
- Provide a https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example[**Minimal, Reproducible Example - with HelloController**]  that reproduces the problem

== Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you think you have found a security vulnerability in Spring Boot please *DO NOT*
disclose it publicly until we've had a chance to fix it.
Please don't report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead head over to support@springdoc.org and learn how to disclose them responsibly.

== Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.
They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* We use the https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/[Spring JavaFormat] project to apply code formatting conventions.
If you use Eclipse and you follow the '`Importing into eclipse`' instructions below you should get project specific formatting automatically.
You can also install the
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/#intellij-idea[Spring JavaFormat IntelliJ
 Plugin]
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
`@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions], if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes #XXXX` at the end of the commit message (where `XXXX` is the issue number).

== Working with the Code

If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use IntellIJ.

=== Importing into IntelliJ IDEA

If you have performed a checkout of this repository already, use "`File`" -> "`Open`" and then select the root `build.gradle` file to import the code.

Alternatively, you can let IntellIJ IDEA checkout the code for you.
Use "`File`" ->
"`New`" -> "`Project from Version Control`" and
`https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi.git` for the URL.
Once the checkout has completed, a pop-up will suggest to open the project.

==== Install the Spring Formatter plugin

If you haven't done so, install the formatter plugin so that proper formatting rules are applied automatically when you reformat code in the IDE.

* Download the latest https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.spring.javaformat%20AND%20a:spring-javaformat-intellij-plugin[IntelliJ IDEA plugin].
* Select "`IntelliJ IDEA`" -> "`Preferences`".
* Select "`Plugins`".
* Select the wheel and "`Install Plugin from Disk...`".
* Select the jar file you've downloaded.

==== Import additional code style

The formatter does not cover all rules (such as order of imports) and an additional file needs to be added.

* Select "`IntelliJ IDEA`" -> "`Preferences`".
* Select "`Editor`" -> "`Code Style`".
* Select the wheel and "`Import Scheme`" -> "`IntelliJ IDEA code style XML`".
* Select https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/idea/codeStyleConfig.xml[`idea/codeStyleConfig.xml`] from this repository.

==== Importing into Eclipse

You can use Spring Boot project specific source formatting settings.

===== Install the Spring Formatter plugin

* Select "`Help`" -> "`Install New Software`".
* Add `https://repo.spring.io/javaformat-eclipse-update-site/` as a site.
* Install "Spring Java Format".

NOTE: The plugin is optional.
Projects can be imported without the plugins, your code changes just won't be automatically formatted.

=== Building from Source

springdoc-openapi source can be built from the command line using https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] on JDK 1.8 or above.

The project can be built from the root directory using the standard maven command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvn install
----

== Cloning the git repository on Windows

Some files in the git repository may exceed the Windows maximum file path (260 characters), depending on where you clone the repository.
If you get `Filename too long`
errors, set the `core.longPaths=true` git option:

```
git clone -c core.longPaths=true https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi
```
